## Problem Description

Given a Number `n` you have to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers. A palindromic 
number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

## Test-Cases 

```
console.log(largestPalindromeProduct(2)); // It should return 9009
console.log(largestPalindromeProduct(3)); // It should return 580085
```

The First Test-Case is passing. The second Test-Case is failing. Find the Bug in the Code Logic and resolve them.
